# Copy Tracks

**Copy Tracks** is the most granular copy operation in Octatrack Manager. It copies individual track data (sound design and/or pattern triggers) between parts and patterns, within or across projects.

:::tip
Tracks aren’t treated as first-class entities in the [Octatrack's architecture](/img/screenshots/ot-architecture.png). This feature goes beyond existing limitations, giving users the power to craft a precise and flexible combination of elements that make up a “track” without being constrained by existing structures.

## Workflow

1. **Source:** Select the bank (A–P), part (1–4), and track (T1–T8 for audio, M1–M8 for MIDI).
2. **Destination:** Choose the target project, bank, part(s), and track(s).
3. **Copy Mode:** Choose what data to copy — Part Parameters, Pattern Triggers, or Both.
4. **Execute:** Perform the track copy.

## Copy Modes

- **Part Parameters:** Copies per-track sound design data (machine type, amp, LFO, FX, volumes, recorder setup). 
    - Both saved and unsaved (working) Part states are transferred, but only for the selected tracks — all other tracks' data in both states is completely preserved. 
    - **The destination Part becomes a hybrid gracefully**: selected tracks get source data in both states, while non-selected tracks keep their existing saved and unsaved data untouched. 
    - Part names are **not** copied, since only selected tracks are modified.
- **Pattern Triggers:** Copies only the sequencer data (triggers, trigless trigs, parameter locks, swing) for the selected tracks. Sound design settings remain unchanged.
- **Both:** Copies both sound design settings and sequencer data for a complete transfer.

## Track Mapping

A single source track can be copied to one or multiple destination(s):

- **Single source → single destination:** Copies one track to one target.
- **Single source → multiple destinations:** A single source track can be copied to multiple destination tracks (e.g., T1 → T1, T3, T5).
- **All Audio / All MIDI:** Select All Audio (T1–T8) or All MIDI (M1–M8) to copy all tracks 1-to-1.

## Pattern Selection

When using **Both** or **Pattern Triggers** mode, you can select which patterns to copy:

- **Pattern 1 (default):** Both "Both" and "Pattern Triggers" modes default to Pattern 1 as source and destination.
- **Specific source pattern → multiple destinations:** A single source pattern can be copied to one or more destination patterns.

## Important Notes

- **Track Type Consistency:** Audio tracks (T1–T8) can only be copied to audio targets, and MIDI tracks (M1–M8) to MIDI targets.
- **Part Names Not Copied:** Since Copy Tracks only modifies selected tracks, the destination Part name is preserved: Overwriting it with the source Part name would be misleading for a hybrid Part.
- **Automatic Backup:** The app automatically backs up the destination bank file before executing. See [Tools Overview](./index.md) for details.
- **Sample Slot References:** This tool only copies the **reference to a sample slot id** (which Slot is assigned to track), not the Sample Slot metadata, nor audio file itself. Use [Copy Sample Slots](./copy-sample-slots.md) to transfer audio files.
