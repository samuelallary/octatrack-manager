# Copy Tracks

**Copy Tracks** is the most granular copy operation in Octatrack Manager. It copies individual track data (sound design and/or pattern triggers) between parts and patterns, within or across projects.

## Workflow

1. **Source:** Select the bank (A–P), part (1–4), and track (T1–T8 for audio, M1–M8 for MIDI).
2. **Destination:** Choose the target project, bank, part(s), and track(s). Multiple destination parts and tracks can be selected when the source is a single track.
3. **Copy Mode:** Choose what data to copy — Part Parameters, Pattern Triggers, or Both.
4. **Execute:** Perform the track copy.

## Copy Modes

- **Part Parameters:** Copies per-track sound design data (machine type, amp, LFO, FX, volumes, recorder setup). Both saved and unsaved (working) Part states are transferred, but only for the selected tracks — all other tracks' data in both states is completely preserved. The destination Part becomes a hybrid gracefully: selected tracks get source data in both states, while non-selected tracks keep their existing saved and unsaved data untouched. The destination Part's edited bitmask is updated. Part names are **not** copied, since only selected tracks are modified.
- **Pattern Triggers:** Copies only the sequencer data (triggers, trigless trigs, parameter locks, swing) for the selected tracks. Sound design settings remain unchanged. Defaults to Pattern 1 (not All patterns).
- **Both:** Copies both sound design settings and sequencer data for a complete transfer.

## Track Mapping

- **Single source → single destination:** Copies one track to one target.
- **Single source → multiple destinations:** A single source track can be copied to multiple destination tracks (e.g., T1 → T1, T3, T5).
- **All Audio / All MIDI:** Select All Audio (T1–T8) or All MIDI (M1–M8) to copy all tracks 1-to-1.

## Pattern Selection

When using **Both** or **Pattern Triggers** mode, you can select which patterns to copy:

- **Pattern 1 (default):** Both "Both" and "Pattern Triggers" modes default to Pattern 1 as source and destination.
- **Specific source pattern → multiple destinations:** A single source pattern can be copied to one or more destination patterns.

## Important Notes

- **Track Type Consistency:** Audio tracks (T1–T8) can only be copied to audio targets, and MIDI tracks (M1–M8) to MIDI targets.
- **Part Names Not Copied:** Since Copy Tracks only modifies selected tracks, the destination Part name is preserved. Overwriting it with the source Part name would be misleading for a hybrid Part.
- **Automatic Backup:** The app automatically backs up the destination bank file before executing. See [Tools Overview](./index.md) for details.
- **Sample Slot References:** This tool copies references to sample slots, not the audio files themselves. Use [Copy Sample Slots](./copy-sample-slots.md) to transfer audio files.
