# Copy Sample Slots

**Copy Sample Slots** manages the 256 sample slots (128 Static, 128 Flex) across projects. It copies slot assignments and can transfer or reorganize the underlying audio files.

## Workflow

1. **Source:** The current project's sample slots are used as the source. Use `One` mode to select a single slot, or `Range` mode to select a contiguous range (with dual sliders).
2. **Destination:** Select the destination slot positions in target project.
3. **Configure Options:** Choose slot type, audio file handling, and editor settings.
4. **Execute:** Perform the sample slot copy.

## Configuration Options

### Slot Type
- **Static + Flex:** Copy both Static and Flex slot assignments.
- **Static Only:** Copy only Static slot assignments; Flex slots are untouched.
- **Flex Only:** Copy only Flex slot assignments; Static slots are untouched.

### Audio Files
- **Copy:** Copy referenced audio files to the destination project's root directory (by filename only, regardless of where the source file is located). `.ot` metadata files are included only when **Include Editor Settings** is enabled. The destination slot path is updated to reference the file in the project root.
- **Move to Pool:** Move audio files to the Set's shared `AUDIO/` folder and update slot paths to `../AUDIO/` in **both** the source and destination projects.
    - Only available when source and destination projects are in the same Set.
    - If a source file is also referenced by the opposite slot type (e.g., a file used by both a Static and Flex slot), the original file is kept to avoid breaking the other reference — the success message reports how many shared files were preserved.
- **Don't Copy:** Copy only the slot assignment data (file path reference); no audio files are transferred.

:::tip
When the audio file mode is set to **Copy** or **Move to Pool**, a warning badge is displayed if any source audio files are missing on disk.

### Include Editor Settings
When enabled, copies:

- per-slot editor settings stored in the project file (gain, BPM, loop mode, timestretch, trig quantization)
- markers stored in the markers file (trim points, loop points, slices)
- and `.ot` metadata files from the source slots.

When disabled, project and marker settings are reset to defaults in the destination, and `.ot` files are not copied.

:::note
This option is always enabled and cannot be toggled off when using **Move to Pool**, since relocating files must preserve all metadata — including `.ot` files which the Octatrack expects alongside the audio file.

## Slot Mapping

Each copied slot(s) respects user selection regarding destination slot ID: For example, copying source slot 2 to destination slot 10 results in a slot with `slot_id = 10`, not the source's original ID.

That's true for both `One` and `Range` source selection.

In case selected destination slot does not leave enough room for all selected source slots (`Range` mode), the warning _Some slots will overflow_ is displayed and the "Execute" button is disabled to prevent an invalid copy. Adjust the source range or the destination start slot to resolve the overflow before executing.

## Important Notes

- **Automatic Backup:** Before executing, the app automatically backs up `project.work`, `markers.work`, and any destination audio files (`.wav` + `.ot`) that would be overwritten.
    - When using **Move to Pool**, the source project's `project.work` and audio files are also backed up since both are modified.
    - See [Tools Overview](./index.md) for details.
- **Move to Pool:** Only available when both projects are in the same Set. The option auto-switches to "Copy" if you select a destination project in a different Set.
- **Shared Files:** When using Move to Pool, files referenced by both Static and Flex slots are not deleted from the source location to prevent breaking cross-references.
