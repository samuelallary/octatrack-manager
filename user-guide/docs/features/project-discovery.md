# Project Discovery

The Home page is your starting point for browsing and organizing your Octatrack work.

## Finding Your Projects

When you open Octatrack Manager, the first step is to locate your projects. You can do this in two ways:

### 1. Automatic Scanning
Click **Scan for Projects** to trigger a comprehensive search across your system. The app searches:

- **Removable Drives:** All mounted CompactFlash (CF) cards and USB drives.
- **System Folders:** Common locations like `~/Documents`, `~/Music`, `~/Downloads`, and `~/Desktop`.
- **Octatrack Folders:** Any folder on your home directory named `octatrack` (in any capitalization).

### 2. Manual Browsing
If your projects are stored in a non-standard location (e.g. a specific backup drive or a cloud-synced folder):
1. Click **Browse...**.
2. Select the directory you want to scan.
3. The app will search that directory recursively and add all found Sets and projects to the results.

### Refreshing the Results
If you insert a CF card or move files while the app is open, click the **Refresh** (↻) button in the header: The app will rescan all its known locations.

## Navigating the Results

Results are organized by **Location**, which corresponds to a Set on your CF card or computer.

### Set Locations
Each location card provides key information at a glance:
- **Device Type:** Labeled as **CF Card**, **USB**, or **Local Copy**.
- **Audio Pool Status:** A **✓ Audio Pool** indicates that the `AUDIO/` folder contains valid samples. An **✗ Audio Pool** means it is missing or empty.
- **Project Count:** Shows how many projects were found in that specific Set.

Click the **▶** arrow on a location card to expand it and see the individual projects within.

### Individual Projects
If projects are found outside of a Set (i.e., they are standalone `.work` or `.strd` files without a parent `AUDIO/` folder), they are listed in the **Individual Projects** section at the bottom.

These projects can be opened and edited like any other, but because they do not have a dedicated Audio Pool and are not part of a set, features related to Audio Pool mangement are not available.

## Opening a Project

To open a project and start working:
1. Locate the project name in the expanded list.
2. Click the project card.
3. You will be taken to the [Project Detail](./project-detail.md) page.

---

## Project Status Indicators

Inside each project card, you will see two status markers:

| Marker | What it means |
|--------|----------------|
| **✓ Project** | The main project file (`project.work`) was found and is readable. |
| **✓ Banks** | All associated bank files (e.g., `bank01.work`) were found. |

If a marker is **✗**, it indicates a missing or corrupted file. This can happen when projects are partially copied or moved manually in your computer's file manager.
